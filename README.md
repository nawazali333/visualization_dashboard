# Data Visualization Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive data visualization dashboard designed to provide insightful visualizations from a given JSON dataset. The dashboard is built using the Flask/Django framework for the backend, with a choice of modern frontend technologies such as JavaScript/Bootstrap, Angular, or React. The primary objective is to transform the raw JSON data into an interactive and insightful visual analytics tool.

## Features
- **Backend**: Developed using Flask/Django to handle data processing and API creation.
- **Database**: JSON data is stored in a database of your choice (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL).
- **Frontend**: Dynamic and responsive UI built with JavaScript/Bootstrap, Angular, or React.
- **Visualizations**: Utilizes powerful charting libraries such as D3.js (recommended), Chart.js, FusionCharts, Plotly.js, Google Charts, or Highcharts for creating interactive and insightful visualizations.
- **API**: Python APIs are created to fetch data from the database and serve it to the frontend for visualization.
- **Interactivity**: Interactive graphs, charts, and visuals that allow users to explore data through various filters.

## Key Variables
The dashboard visualizes important variables including:
- Intensity
- Likelihood
- Relevance
- Year
- Country
- Topics
- Region
- City

## Filters
The dashboard includes multiple filters to help users drill down into the data:
- End Year
- Topics
- Sector
- Region
- PEST (Political, Economic, Social, Technological)
- Source
- SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)
- Country
- City
- Additional filters based on data insights
